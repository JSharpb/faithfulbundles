            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>Each month, we curate a bundle of Christian eBooks including everything from devotionals and Bible study helpers to testimonials and 
                Christian literature. Not only that, <strong>20% of proceeds go to Christian non-profits</strong> that will help those in need and 
                spread the Gospel to every corner of the earth.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>When you purchase a bundle, we email you a link to the download page where you can download and enjoy DRM-free copies
                of your new eBooks. You can then read them on your favorite device whether that be your trusty Kindle or your battle-worn laptop.
