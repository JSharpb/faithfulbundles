        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>Each month, we curate a selection of Christian eBooks with a new and interesting theme. Then, we bundle them together so you never run out of
            something to read and you save money in the process. Not only that, <strong>20% of proceeds go to Christian non-profits</strong> that will help those in need and spread the Gospel to every corner of the earth.
        </p>

    <section class="how">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>When you purchase a bundle, we email you a link to the download page where you can download and enjoy DRM-free copies
            of your new eBooks. You can then read them on your favorite device whether that be your trusty Kindle or your battle-worn laptop.
            <br><br>Want to purchase a bundle as a gift? No problem! We will email it for you.
